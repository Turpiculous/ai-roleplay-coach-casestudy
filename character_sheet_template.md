## Personality & Roleplay

### Appearance
Bayard is a man who wears his history on his skin. He is bald with a lean, wiry build, and a short, neatly-trimmed goatee that has turned grey with age. His most striking feature is the dense network of black, goblin-style tribal tattoos that cover his scalp, face, neck, chest, and arms. These are not mere decorations but a testament to the shamanic rite he endured; a complex web of sharp lines, glyphs, and symbols that obscure the man he once was. He typically wears a simple, coarse brown robe, often left open to reveal the ink beneath, giving him the appearance of an ascetic or a man who has long forsaken worldly comforts. His eyes are intense and intelligent, reflecting a life of focused study and the heavy burden of the secrets he carries.

### Traits, Ideals, Bonds & Flaws
- **Personality Traits:**
    - I’m oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.
    - I sleep with my back to a wall or tree, with everything I own wrapped in a bundle in my arms.
    - There’s nothing I like more than a good mystery.
- **Ideals:**
    - "Those who destroy knowledge, with ink, fire, or sword, are themselves destroyed"
- **Bonds:**
    - Should my discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.
    - I entered seclusion to hide from the ones who might still be hunting me. I must someday confront them.
- **Flaws:**
    - I’d risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge.

## Background & History

### Pre-Campaign History
A third-grade academicus (researcher) in the Venerable Society of the Seekers of the Arcana, though not a lofty position in this guild of Sages, is still one that guarantees a decent stipend, modest city lodgings and access to the considerable library. With training in the divinatory arts and paid time off from the scriptorium on holy days included. 
Bayard Gunt, however, was not one that relished his time off. His work was his passion and the company of books and scrolls, was more to his liking than that of people. His special area of expertise was in the field of Demi-mondism-the study of Goblinoids. A genus of humanoids, which he found fascinating and charming. Which understandably evoked the sort of grimaces from his peers, that would normally be reserved for Scatological studies or Arachnologists. His peers were always happy to offload research work in that field onto him, it meant that they could deal with more notable and respectable research instead. 
However, it has been two years since Bayard has seen any of his peers. He had uncovered 'the secret', in the course of his research. 'The secret', would in the wrong hands be catastrophic. He was under no illusions that should the 'Benign Order of the Third Eye find out he knew, then the best he could hope for is not to live long enough to see the consequences of 'the secret' being revealed.  
There was only one answer- to flee and hide. Fleeing from Diviners is no easy task and hiding harder still. There was but one crazy plan however that might work. Previous academics had written of a form of 'Deceptorium Rite', practised by the Goblins. One that could make the subject less susceptible to scrying. All he had to do was to convince some Goblins to take him in, agree to perform the shamanic rite and then survive it. 
It had been no easy feat, finding the Gazuk Tribe. Goblins weren't pre-disposed to humans as a rule. But he had spent a career studying their ways and superstitions to his favour. 
But everything has its price... now a year on since the rite was performed and pursuit has yet to find its mark. Life amongst Goblins has its charms and they are very fascinating after all. The few who trade with the Goblins are never short of a tale or two. Perhaps the story of a ragged human wretch amongst the Goblins, who names himself 'Barn Yard' was of little note to those heard. After all, Goblins have been known to take slaves before. But perhaps those who listened more keenly might have noted how this wretch seemed to be no slave at all.

### Key Allies & Factions (Pre-Campaign)
- **The Gazuk Tribe (Goblins):** Currently hiding out with them. Seen as a Goblin Seer.
    - **Wuuruh:** Chief - Thick and Huge.

Their desire is to improve the Schools of Magic, not necessarily to foster good relations, and they have been known to steal knowledge.

## Detailed Spellbook

### Cantrips
- **Blade Ward:** *You hear Bayard utter his spell "With chanted vow, my will I bind, A shield of force, for body and mind." He traces a protective sigil over himself. "No claw shall rend, no blade shall tear, against the dread that fills this air!" His hands move in a quick, precise gesture, as if weaving threads of air. For a brief moment, the air around them seems to ripple, almost imperceptibly, hardening into an unseen barrier.*
- **Minor Illusion:** *Bayard's fingers twitch, deftly manipulating something unseen, as a small bit of fleece dances through his fingers. The air around the chosen spot shimmers like heat haze, then coalesces into a static image or a chilling sound emanates from nothing.*
- **Prestidigitation:** *Bayard makes a series of delicate, almost imperceptible gestures, muttering "By will and whisper, I command, a subtle change by gesture of hand." His fingers flick in small, quick hand movements. A fleeting scent might drift on the air, a spark might flicker into life, or a small, ephemeral trinket might shimmer into existence for a moment.*
- **True Strike**

### 1st Level Spells
- **Absorb Elements:** *As a bolt of lightning or a gout of flame strikes Bayard, they raise a hand almost instinctively, a barely perceptible flicker of light blooming around them. The blow seems to lose some of its force, and the elemental energy clings to Bayard for a moment before dissolving.*
- **Alarm:** *Bayard moves with careful, deliberate steps, unwinding a thin, shimmering silver wire around the area. He then takes a small, tarnished handbell, tracing its rim as he murmurs "With silver thread and solemn chime, I weave a ward against all time, Let unseen eyes and silent tread, Be heralded, alive or dead!"*
- **Comprehend Languages:** *Bayard takes a pinch of dark soot and a few grains of salt, carefully mixing them in his palm before blowing them away with a soft whisper "From soot and salt, a vision clears, the tongue of stranger, ancient years. My mind attuned, my senses keen, Let every word be truly seen!"*
- **Detect Magic:** *Bayard closes his eyes for a moment, then firmly proclaims "By whispered word, by sensing hand, Let magic glow throughout this land. Unveil the unseen, the hidden gleam, And show me truth, from magic's dream!"*
- **Find Familiar:** *Bayard sits amidst a cloud of swirling, scented incense smoke, his hands performing intricate, weaving gestures. "From smoke and flame, a spirit weaves, through shadowed veil, and haunted leaves. By ancient pact, by whispered plea, Come, watchful eye, and serve with me!"*
- **Identify:** *Bayard carefully takes a pearl, holding it aloft as he begins a resonant chant. "With pearl's pure light, I pierce the veil, Let hidden truths to me prevail..." His free hand traces intricate, shimmering patterns in the air above the object.*
- **Protection from Evil and Good:** *Bayard clutches a pouch of powdered silver and iron, sprinkling it in a wide arc as he utters "By sacred vow, and silver gleam, I raise a ward, against the dream of fiend and shadow, unholy might, Begone, dark things, from my pure light!"*
- **Tenser's Floating Disk:** *A shimmering drop of mercury falls from Bayard's hand as he incants "By drop of quicksilver, earth defies, A disc of force, before my eyes. By unseen strength, by subtle hand, Let burdens lift, at my command!"*

### 2nd Level Spells
- **Detect Thoughts:** *Bayard flips a copper coin, catching it neatly in his palm, then presses it briefly to his forehead while murmuring "By copper's echo, thoughts unfurl, Secrets within this shadowed world. My hand to mind, a bridge I make, Let silent whispers, now awake!"*
- **Invisibility:** *Bayard plucks a single eyelash, blowing it from his palm as he chants softly "With eyelash fine, and whispered plea, Let sight and image now cease to be. My hand extends, the veil I draw, Beyond the eye, beyond nature's law!"*
- **Magic Weapon:** *Bayard grasps the chosen weapon, his hand glowing faintly as he intones "By fervent word, by spirit's might, I grasp the blade, and grant it light! Let mundane steel, by arcane fire, Strike true and deep, with fierce desire!"*
- **Nystul's Magic Aura**

### 3rd Level Spells
- **Clairvoyance:** *Bayard holds a polished brass horn to his ear or a smooth glass eye to his own, and utters "By brass and eye, my senses send, A watchful gaze, around the bend. My mind extends, my spirit flies, To pierce the gloom, and heed the cries!"*
- **Counterspell:** *As an enemy begins to conjure a spell, Bayard's hand snaps out, fingers splayed, as if pushing against an invisible force. A sharp crackle of energy fills the air.*
- **Dispel Magic:** *Bayard extends a hand towards the magical target, his voice firm and clear. "By spoken word, and open hand, I bid this magic, now disband! Let threads unravel, power cease, And bring this captive soul to peace!"*
- **Etched Spell:** *Bayard takes up a specialised stylus and a selection of dark, shimmering inks to etch a spell onto a willing creature's skin. *(See Homebrew & Custom Content section for full details)*
- **Glyph of Warding:** *Bayard meticulously scatters a fine, sparkling dust over the chosen surface, his fingers tracing complex patterns that hum with latent power as he incants "By diamond dust, and through my will, a warding sign, for good or ill..."*
- **Remove Curse:** *Bayard reaches out, placing a firm, steady hand upon the cursed target, his brow furrowed as he forces the words out "By whispered word, by touch I break, the chains of ill, for freedom's sake. Let shadows flee, let darkness fade, No curse shall bind, what I've remade!"*
- **The Rite of Guarded Tidings:** *The air grows heavy as Bayard prepares the ancient ritual, laying out a copper wire in a ten-foot circle around himself and a speaker... *(See Homebrew & Custom Content section for full details)*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action + 10 minutes (Ritual)
- **Range/Area:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered
- **Description:** This ritual allows a spellcaster to etch a prepared spell onto a willing creature's skin using a specialized stylus and inks. The spell's essence is embedded into intricate symbols. The spell etched will always target the recipient themselves.
- **Ritual Casting:** The caster must succeed on an Arcana check (DC 10 + the level of the spell to be etched). The casting time is 1 hour for a cantrip, plus 1 additional hour for each level of the spell being etched. Proficiency with Calligrapher's Supplies can be added to the Arcana check.
- **Trigger:** A triggering condition must be set by the caster. When the condition occurs, the recipient must use their Reaction to cast the spell. If their reaction is unavailable, the spell cannot be triggered. The tattoo disappears upon use.
- **Concentration:** If the spell requires concentration, the recipient is considered the caster for maintaining it.
- **Exhaustion:** The target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw for every hour of the ritual. On a failed save, the target gains 1 level of exhaustion.

- **Communication:** The exchange is limited to 6-second messages back and forth. The caster must concentrate to maintain the link.
- **Extending the Rite:** To extend the communication for another 6-second exchange, the caster must make a Concentration saving throw. The DC is 10 and increases by 5 for each subsequent extension.
- **Exhaustion:** On a failed Concentration save, the caster suffers 1 point of exhaustion for each extension used up to that point, and the spell ends. For example, failing the DC 20 save for the third total exchange results in 2 levels of exhaustion.
