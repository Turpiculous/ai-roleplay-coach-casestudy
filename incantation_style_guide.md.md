# Incantation Style Guide for the Roleplay Coach Gem

### 1. Core Philosophy

Incantations are more than mere magical triggers; they are a vital tool for roleplaying and character expression. They should be evocative, personal, and narratively significant. The goal is not just to cast a spell, but to tell a micro-story about how a character bends reality to their will.

### 2. The Four Pillars of Style

Every incantation should be built upon the following four principles, which form the foundation of our established style:

1.  **Descriptive & Evocative:** The words must paint a vivid picture. They should use strong, sensory language that hints at the spell's effect. Instead of saying "I cast a spell," the words *are* the spell taking form.
2.  **Poetic & Rhythmic:** Incantations must have a clear cadence and flow, like a fragment of an ancient poem or a powerful chant. A preference has been shown for rhyming couplets and a consistent meter, such as iambic tetrameter (da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM).
3.  **Thematic & Character-Driven:** The language must align with the spell's school and purpose. More importantly, it must reflect the character's background and source of power. A Cleric's incantation will sound different from a Wizard's, which will differ from a Druid's.
4.  **Source-Focused:** The words should allude to where the magic comes from. Is the character tapping into the cosmic Weave of magic, petitioning a divine entity, calling upon primal spirits, or using sheer force of will? The incantation should reflect this.

### 3. Structural Rules & Component Integration

The structure of an incantation is not arbitrary. It is defined by the mechanical requirements of the spell itself.

#### 3.1. Component Weaving
The incantation must artfully integrate the spell's required components:

* **Verbal (V):** The incantation itself is the verbal component.
* **Somatic (S):** If gestures are needed, the words should allude to them. Use active phrases that describe the casting motion.
    * *Examples:* "With this gesture, I do bind...", "I trace the sigil in the air...", "My hands now weave a silver thread..."
* **Material (M):** The material component must be referenced, either directly by name or through elegant metaphor.
    * *Spell:* `Find Familiar` (requires charcoal, incense, and herbs)
    * *Incantation:* "By charcoal drawn and incense burned, by sacred herbs, a spirit's turned."
    * *Spell:* `Lightning Bolt` (requires a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)
    * *Incantation:* "By amber's heart and twilight's fur, I call the storm, a blinding blur!"

#### 3.2. Length Correlation
The length and complexity of the incantation must directly correspond to the spell's casting time:

* **Short Cast (1 Action, Bonus Action, Reaction):** The incantation must be concise and potent, typically **2 to 4 lines**. It is a burst of power.
* **Long Cast (1 minute or longer):** The incantation should be significantly more elaborate, often structured as **multiple stanzas**. This reflects the extended time and focus involved in the casting.

#### 3.3. Differentiating Rituals: Preparation & Incantation
Spells with a Ritual tag are treated with special significance, representing a deeper and more involved connection to magic. For any spell identified as a ritual, the output must include two distinct parts:

* **Ritual Preparation Description:** A prose paragraph describing the actions performed during the extended casting time. This description **must be written in the third person**, using the character's actual name. Crucially, it **must be grounded in the character's known personality and methods.** A meticulous character's description should be precise and ordered; a chaotic character's should be frenzied and intuitive. The description is for the player to read or paraphrase as they roleplay the preparation.
* **Final Incantation:** The lengthy, multi-stanza incantation that is spoken at the culmination of the ritual to unleash the magic.

**Example: The *Find Familiar* Ritual (for a character named "Elara," who is known to be a precise and academic Wizard)**

* **Ritual Preparation Description:**
    > Elara kneels, her movements economical and precise as she clears a space on the stone floor. With a sharpened stick of charcoal, she draws a perfect circle, scribing flawless, academic glyphs for binding and beckoning. At the circle's exact center, Elara places a brass brazier, adding the pre-measured amounts of incense and herbs. As fragrant smoke begins to rise in a steady, controlled column, she closes her eyes, hands held steady over the circle. For the better part of an hour, Elara's focus is absolute, her breathing even and controlled as her mind reaches into the ethereal with the disciplined focus of a scholar, calling for a spirit to answer her structured summons.

* **Final Incantation:**
    > "By charcoal drawn, a circle bound,
    > On this arcane and hallowed ground.
    > By fragrant smoke and herbs alight,
    > I call a spirit from the night.
    >
    > A loyal friend, of feather, fur,
    > Let life and magic now concur.
    > My will the thread, my soul the gate,
    > Come now, companion, seal our fate!
    >
    > From planes unseen, I bid you speed,
    > To serve me in my time of need.
    > A willing heart, a spirit bright,
    > Step forth and greet the mortal light!"
